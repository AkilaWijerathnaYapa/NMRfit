# NMRfit

## Overview

NMRfit is a software package for fitting NMR data using customizable YAML configuration files. It processes data files and outputs results in a user-specified format.

NMRfit is a command-line package specifically designed for peak fitting and analysis of NMR spectra and supports both Windows and Linux platforms, enabling users to process and fit data with ease.

  ## Folder Structure
  
  - **`Data/`**: Contains raw or processed data files.
- **`Figures/`**: Figures and images for documentation or analysis.
- **`Other_SW_based_data_analysis/`**: Holds supplementary data analysis results.
- **`Package/`**: Core files necessary for running the software:
  - `fit_all.bat`: Batch script to process all YAML files in the current directory.
- `optimized.yaml`: Example YAML configuration file with parameters and dataset definitions.
- `rnmrfit`: Script or binary for analysis (primarily for UNIX-based systems).
- `rnmrfit.exe`: Main executable for the software (Windows).
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the software package.

## Package Contents
  
### 1. `fit_all.bat`
  A batch script designed for Windows to process all `.yaml` files in the `Package` directory. The script uses PowerShell to execute the NMRfit software:
  
  ```bat
start powershell -command "& '.\rnmrfit.exe' *.yaml -o fit"
```

- **Usage**: Double-click the script or run it in a command prompt from the `Package` directory.
- **Output**: Results are saved in the specified output directory (e.g., `fit`).

### 2. `optimized.yaml`
This is an example configuration file that defines parameter settings, datasets, species, and processing options for the NMRfit software.

Key Sections:
  - **`processing`**:
  - `zf`: Zero filling factor.
- `lb`: Line broadening parameter.
- `phase`: Enables phase correction.
- `reference`: Sets reference ppm and threshold values.

- **`parameters`**:
  - Defines fitting parameters, such as peak width and fraction.

- **`general_bounds`**:
  - `width`: Specifies general bounds for peak width.

- **`offset_bounds`**:
  - `position`: Adjusts peak position.
- `height`: Modifies peak height.

- **`ranges`**:
  - Defines cutoff for data processing.

- **`baseline`**:
  - Specifies baseline correction with span and polynomial degree.

- **`phase`**:
  - Sets phase order and bounds.

- **Datasets**:
  Each dataset corresponds to a specific sample path:
  ```yaml
dataset: "1"
path: "./2H-VAN-1"
```

- **Species and Resonances**:
  Defines chemical species and their respective resonances:
  ```yaml
species: "vanillin"
resonances: 
  "9.82 s": H1
"8.29 s": H2
```

- **Plotting**:
  Configures plots for data visualization:
  ```yaml
plot: "H1-5"
ppm: [0, 12]
experiments: "*"
species: "*"
```

- **Area Calculations**:
  Calculates area statistics, normalizations, and summaries:
  ```yaml
calculate_areas: "ratio_stats"
sum_by: "resonance"
normalize_by: "TMU::2.82 s"
```

  ## Usage
  
  ### To Run the Software:
  
  **On Windows:**
  1. Open a Command Prompt or double-click `fit_all.bat` in the `Package` directory.
2. Alternatively, execute manually:
  ```cmd
rnmrfit.exe <path_to_yaml_file>
  ```

**On Linux:**
  1. Ensure `rnmrfit` is executable:
  ```bash
chmod +x rnmrfit
```
2. Run the command:
  ```bash
./rnmrfit <path_to_yaml_file>
  ```

  ## YAML Configuration Details
  
  Modify `optimized.yaml` to customize the softwareâ€™s behavior:
  - **Input Datasets**:
  Define each dataset's path and label.
- **Species and Resonances**:
  List compounds and their expected resonance frequencies.
- **Fitting Parameters**:
  Adjust bounds and parameters for peak fitting.
- **Baseline Correction**:
  Fine-tune baseline correction using span and degree settings.
- **Area Calculations**:
  Specify the normalization method and summarization options.
